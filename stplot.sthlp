{title:Description}

{pstd}
{it:stplot} specifies the overall look of graphs.
Three base schemes are available with this command:

{pstd}
1. {it:noaxes} draws plots without axes lines and ticks{break}
2. {it:axes} draws lines along the x-axis and the y-axis{break}
3. {it:box} draws a frame around all the sides of the plot region

{pstd}
{it:stplot} is not a theme.
{it:stplot} is a command that writes the graph style instructions to .scheme file.
This approach offers three distinct advantages over conventional graph scheme packages:

{pstd}
- it includes more control over the base theme to be used in graphs.{break}
- it makes it possible to specify several tweaked versions of a theme to use in different plots.{break}
- it facilitates the visual reproduction of graphs. The .scheme file contains all the instructions necessary to replicate the look of graphs with no installs required (including the {it:stplot} package).

{title:Options}

{pstd}
{bf:{ul:c}olors(}{help colorpalette:colors}{bf:)}: specifies the color scheme to be used in graphs. This option is a wrap of the {help colorpalette} command. It accepts color schemes (e.g. s2color) and lists of color names or their RGB codes (e.g. navy "123 146 168" maroon), or any color palette generated by {help colorpalette}.

{pstd}
{bf:{ul:s}ymbols(}{help symbolstyle:symbols}{bf:)}: specifies the symbols to be used in marker elements.

{pstd}
{bf:{ul:l}ines(}{help linepatternstyle:lines}{bf:)}: specifies the line patterns to be used in line elements.

{pstd}
{bf:legend(}{it:position}{bf:)}: four alternatives available:{break}
1. {it:off} turns off the legend{break}
2. {it:inside} draws the legend inside the plot region{break}
3. {it:side} draws the legend outside of the plot region on its right side{break}
4. {it:bottom} draws the legend outside of the plot region on the bottom.

{pstd}
{bf:nogrid}: turns all the gridlines off.

{pstd}
{bf:noticks}: turns major and minor ticks off. {it: stplot noaxes} uses this option by default.

{pstd}
{bf:altcontrast}: changes the look of certain outline elements from white to black (e.g. outline of histogram bars, petals in sunflower graphs).

{pstd}
{bf:{ul:n}ame(}{it:name}{bf:)}: saves a .scheme file with the specified name. If this option is not specified, the command saves the scheme instructions on file with the name {it:stataplot-scheme.scheme}.
